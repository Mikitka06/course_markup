  <title>BBS Documentary part 1: Baud</title>

  <p1>
    Both the article by Roy Rosenzweig  and BBS documentary helped to  immerse in Internet history and origins and understand how it was shaped and evolved. 
    The most enlightening piece of knowledge at least for me (which I should be embarrassed to admit considering my CIS major ) 
    was the existence of CBBS and pre-bits slow ear of Baud. 
    After doing my additional research on the topic, funnily with the help of the topic aka Internet itself,  I  discovered more fascinating information. 
    A bulletin board system (BBS) is a computer or an application dedicated to the sharing or exchange of messages or other files on a network.
    The BBS became the primary kind of online community through the 1980s and early 1990s, before the World Wide Web arrived.

    Baud was the prevalent measure for data transmission speed until replaced by a more accurate term, bps (bits per second).
    One baud is one electronic state change per second. Since a single state change can involve more than a single bit of data, 
    the bps unit of measurement has replaced it as a better expression of data transmission speed. 
    The measure was named after a French engineer, Jean-Maurice-Emile Baudot. It was first used to measure the speed of telegraph transmissions

      The first BBS, called the Computerized Bulletin Board System (CBBS), was created in 1978 by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess.
      Although ARPANET was in operation at that time, it was restricted to institutions funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. 
      When CBBS went online, it became the first non-military computer-based community, other than timesharing systems 
      (which allotted portions of mainframe processing time to a group of computers). 
      An article by Christensen and Suess published in Byte magazine described CBBS and outlined the technology they had used to develop it, 
      sparking the creation of many tens of thousands of BBSes all over the world.

       Despite the vastly greater reach of the Internet, the BBS is still fairly common in parts of the world where the Internet is less established 
       and is still valued by many with Internet access for its ability to foster a sense of community.

  <p5>   Both the documentary and the article are relatively “old”. Rosenzweig’s article was written in 1998 and since then technology ,
  culture as well as politics and the world itself has evolved. A lot.I couldn’t help but wonder what woulf the author and participants of 
  the documentary say about the modern world of mobile phones, high-speed, low cost internet, social media, app, Facebook, Instagram.. even Selfie, for God’s sake .
  But one of the most crucial topics discussed in his article stay relevant even in today’s world like never before.

    Just recently Cold War seemed to many like a long gone nightmare from 60-s and suddenly we are at the verge of a New Cold Era.
    Do people or society shape the technology and computers or  is it vice versa?
    Who owns the Net? Emerged  as a “meta-medium”  that combined aspects of telephone, post-office, movie theater, TV, shopping mall, 
    street corner and a great deal more, to make the flow of information accessible to all, should  the  Internet be censored or controlled by government?  
    
  </p6>
  <l1>Does the competition for market share among the tech giants result in overall better quality of technology or is it confusing the consumers and slowing down the growth? 
</l1>
<l2>The future remains uncertain but one thing is clear to me: Internet indeed is the “discovery of fire” of our time.
